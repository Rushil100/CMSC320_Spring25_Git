Q1: Why might we consider using Git?
A1: Git is very useful as it allows us to save versions of our code,
    so we can go back to them if something goes wrong. We can also use
    it so that many people can work on a project at the same time and
    they can have their own versions of the code.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.
A2: Data Science can be very helpful in the agriculture feild. The data
    from previous storms and droughts could be used to predict the weather
    conditions. Sensors can be used in the soil to measure moisture and
    farmers could use that to predict the optimal amount of water needed
    and improve their irrigation.
