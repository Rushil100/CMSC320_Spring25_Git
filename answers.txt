Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.
A2: Data Science can be very helpful in the agriculture feild. The data
    from previous storms and droughts could be used to predict the weather
    conditions. Sensors can be used in the soil to measure moisture and
    farmers could use that to predict the optimal amount of water needed
    and improve their irrigation.
