Q1: Why might we consider using Git?
A1: Git is very useful as it allows us to save versions of our code,
    so we can go back to them if something goes wrong. We can also use
    it so that many people can work on a project at the same time and
    they can have their own versions of the code.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.
A2: Data Science can be very helpful in the agriculture feild. The data
    from previous storms and droughts could be used to predict the weather
    conditions. Sensors can be used in the soil to measure moisture and
    farmers could use that to predict the optimal amount of water needed
    and improve their irrigation.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?
A3: When you merge, it combines the 2 branches, but the histories of both the
    branches are still preserved. When you do rebasing, the history of the
    branch is rewritten, the changes made in that branch are placed on top
    of the other branch by making new commits, making it seem that all the
    changes were made in the target branch. (There are no merge commits)

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?
A4:  I wish to learn about how to process all the big datasets into something
     useful, which can be used to make predictions about various fields. I
     also wish to learn about the real life applications of data science, as
     I wish to pursue this field in the future.
